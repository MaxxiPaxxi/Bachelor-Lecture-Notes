# MAA307 - Convex Optimization and Optimal Control

This course, part of Applied Mathematics, handles cases of optimization and optimal control by talking about convex functions and properties of Hilbert spaces. In this course, we will also talk about Lagrangian duality, Lebesgue spaces for optimal control and Legendre-Fenchel transforms.
